# Services

A run down of the services we love and use for making code.

## [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

A hosted continuous integration service tightly integrated with GitHub.
Free for public projects and works great with small modules.

## [Wercker](http://wercker.com/)

Wercker is a continuous delivery platform that helps developers reduce
risk and eliminate waste by testing and deploying their code often.
Very similar to TravisCI but also free for private projects.  Works
great for app projects.

## [Appveyor](http://appveyor.com)

Like wercker and travis, but offers free windows build slaves (swooooon).

## [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)

Tracks test coverage history with a handy UI that's integrated with GitHub.
